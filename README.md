## bcompiler-engine

A new, faster, more efficient, more modular back end for `bcompiler`. No longer
fused together with its belt and braces command line interface, `bcompiler`
deserves a new heart, and this is it.

`bcompiler` will be reborn...

### Aims

* Extract data using multiple cores to do it faster.
* Type checking and rule-setting, allowing for greater confidence in integrity of data.
* Improved, modular design, powering a brand new interface coming soon...
